All the work presented in this thesis was done under the supervision of 
Prof.\ Marcello Restelli, who has instilled in me the passion for this complex 
and fascinating subject and helped me navigate it since the beginning. 
I also thank Dott.\ Carlo D'Eramo for guiding me during my first steps into the 
academic world and inspiring me to pursue a career in research, and 
Dott.\ Matteo Pirotta for providing useful insights and supervision on this work.

It is impossible to summarize the unique experience I had at PoliMi in a few
paragraphs, but I would like to thank Ilyas Inajjar, Giacomo Locci, Angelo 
Gallarello, Davide Conficconi, Alessandro Comodi, Francesco Lattari, Edoardo
Longo, Stefano Longari, Yannick Giovanakis, Paolo Mosca and Andrea Lui for 
sharing their experiences with me and always showing me a different perspective
of the things we do. 
I thank Politecnico di Milano for providing the infrastructure during my 
education and the writing of this thesis, but most importantly for fostering a 
culture of academic excellence, of collaboration, and of passion for the 
disciplines of its students.
I also thank Prof.\ Cremonesi and Prof.\ Alippi for giving me a chance to prove 
myself.

Finally, this thesis is dedicated to my parents, for giving me all that I am and
all that I have; 
to Gaia, for being the reason to always look ahead;
to my grandmothers, for their unconditional love; 
to my grandfather, for always rooting silently.
