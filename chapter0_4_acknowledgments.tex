All the work presented in this thesis was done under the supervision of Prof. 
Marcello Restelli, who has instilled in me the passion for this complex and 
fascinating subject and helped me navigate it for the best part of a year. 
I also thank Dott. Carlo D'Eramo and Dott. Matteo Pirotta for guiding me during 
my first steps into the academic world and inspiring me to pursue a career in 
research. 
It is impossible to summarize the unique experience I had at PoliMi in a few
paragraphs, but I would like to thank Ilyas Inajjar, Giacomo Locci, Angelo 
Gallarello, Davide Conficconi, Alessandro Comodi, Francesco Lattari, Edoardo
Longo, Stefano Longari, Yannick Giovanakis, Paolo Mosca and Andrea Lui for 
sharing their experiences with me and always showing me a different perspective. 
I thank Politecnico di Milano for providing the infrastructure during my education
and the writing of this thesis, but most importantly for fostering a culture 
of academic excellence, of collaboration, and of passion for our disciplines.
I also thank Prof. Cremonesi and Prof. Alippi for giving me a chance to prove 
myself, and Prof. Ardagna for understanding.

Finally, this thesis is dedicated to my parents, for giving me all that I am and
all that I have; 
to Gaia, for being the reason to always look ahead;
to my grandmothers, for their unconditional love; 
to my grandfather, for always rooting silently.
