# Master's Thesis - Daniele Grattarola

This repo contains the Latex source code and additional files required to 
build my Master's thesis and output it as PDF. 

To build, simply run the following in a terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielegrattarola/master-thesis.git
cd master-thesis
make
make clean
```

If you have Evince (default PDF reader of Ubuntu) installed on your system, the 
PDF will automatically open. Otherwise, you can find it at ```master-thesis/thesis.pdf```.
