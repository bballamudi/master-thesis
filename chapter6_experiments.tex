In this chapter we show some experimental results of our algorithm on some Atari
games.
We show that we are able to obtain better performance than the state-of-the-art
approaches in the first five hundred thousand frames of experience starting 
from a fully random policy, and that the agent is able to learn non-trivial 
behaviors.
