\noindent This section will be dedicated to the analysis of the two main areas 
of machine learning around which this thesis revolves: \textit{deep learning} 
and \textit{reinforcement learning}. 
After an introduction of both areas, we 
will describe how the two classes of algorithms can be used together in what is 
called \textit{deep reinforcement learning}.

\section{Deep Learning}
Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning which exploits \textit{Artificial 
Neural Networks} (ANN) with more than one hidden layer to learn an abstract 
representation of the input space \cite{lecun2015deep}. 

Deep learning techniques can be applied to the three main classes of problems 
of machine learning (supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised), and have 
been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of learning tasks.
